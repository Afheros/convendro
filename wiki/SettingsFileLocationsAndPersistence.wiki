#summary A brief primer on Convendro settings, file locations and persistence.

== Introduction ==

This page will discuss several file location of setting files and preset data.

== Settings ==

Convendro uses the '.Net' configuration mechanism: the official settings file will be stored in your documents settings folder (Windows XP) or users' Local App folder.

== Presets and Command description files ==

These files are always stored in the Local App Folder\convendro for Windows Vista and Local Settings\convendro for Windows XP.

== Program ==

The program and associated executables (ffmpeg.exe, for example) are stored in the (user-specified) Program Files folder: Generally, this is the Program Files\Convendro folder. No registry settings are 'abused' (see also the installer code).
