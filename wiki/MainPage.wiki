== Status ==

===At this stage===
  # Conversion was tested with dummy and test presets (see document folder for 2 error-free datafiles).
  # Simple test/dummy terminal to tryout settings.
  # Average ~ 20 minutes (400MB) for 700 KB/s, P7350 2.0 GHz (2 active threads).

No release has been planned at this stage. If you really need to get this, retrieve the sources and compile the app with either SharpDevelop or VS Express:
  # Add commandline parameters for PSP conversion.
  # Changes to threading model. PresetsFile -> Thread is not threadsafe.
  # Changes to object model to support other possible commandline encoders.


===Supported===
  # FFmpeg version SVN-r16596-Sherpya
  # Basic WinFF presets import.
