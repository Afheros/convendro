#summary A user-interface for ffmpeg.

= Introduction =

Convendro is a .Net GUI for [ffmpeg]


== Details ==

  * Easy to use: Drag and drop your media files.
  * Easy preset management: either add ffmpeg settings or copy your favourite FFMPEG commandline right into the Presets Editor
  * No intruding advertisements or clumsy interface.
  * For recent screenshots, check SVN trunk/Web.

== Status ==

At this stage:
  # Conversion was tested with dummy and test presets (see document folder for 2 error-free datafiles).
  # Average ~ 20 minutes (400MB) for 700 KB/s, P7350 2.0 GHz (2 active threads).

No release has been planned at this stage. If you really need to get this, retrieve the sources and compile the app with either SharpDevelop or VS Express:
  # Add commandline parameters for PSP conversion.
  # Changes to threading model. PresetsFile -> Thread is not threadsafe.
  # Changes to object model to support other possible commandline encoders.


Current supported FFMPEG version(s):
  # FFmpeg version SVN-r16596-Sherpya
