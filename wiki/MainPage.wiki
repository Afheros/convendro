= Introduction =

Convendro is a .Net GUI for [ffmpeg]


== Details ==

  * Easy to use: Drag and drop your media files.
  * Easy preset management: either add ffmpeg settings or copy your favourite FFMPEG commandline right into the Presets Editor
  * No intruding advertisements or clumsy interface.

== Status ==

At this stage:
  # Conversion was tested with dummy and test presets (see document folder for 2 error-free datafiles).
  # Average ~ 20 minutes (400MB) for 700 KB/s, P7350 2.0 GHz (2 active threads).

The following changes are being considered before the first alpha gets out:
  # Add commandline parameters for PSP conversion.
  # Changes to threading model. PresetsFile -> Thread is not threadsafe.
  # Changes to object model to support other possible commandline encoders.
