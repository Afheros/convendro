## Introduction ##
A front-end for ffmpeg, for converting and transcoding mediafiles. Written in C#, .Net, and probably Mono. If you're curious what this looks like, please check out the Source/Trunk/web/ directory.

## Sources ##
You can retrieve the sources from SVN, and compile the app with either SharpDevelop or VS Express. Or you can download the sources from http://github.com/hooverdirt/convendro.

Please use the Antares branch for the latest changes. Thanks.

## Binaries/Installation ##
**Please download the applicable installer for your Windows version.** By default, convendro WILL NOT include any presets. You should import the accompanying presets yourself.
**The installers do not yet 'upgrade' files automatically. Please preserve your original presets file before you install the latest version.**
