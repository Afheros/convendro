# Introduction #

A short introduction about development, compilation and stuff


## Primer ##

  * Use the Google Code instructions to fetch the latest version from SVN (Trunk for now)
  * Get the cmddesc.xml and PresetsData.xml file from the Documents folder and copy to your Bin\Debug folder. These files will be generated on the fly when starting the program but having these files makes it easier.
  * Download a recent version of [ffmpeg](ffmpeg.md) (preferably SVN). Note, the binary distribution will probably contain [ffmpeg](ffmpeg.md).
  * Compile/Build/Run.
